Although there are numerous popular apps that aim to increase transparency of crime, our app was made for the lack of effort in making police activity transparent to communities, which is increasingly important in light of recent events.  Whatâ€™s more, the access to information of Citizen Rights is not always readily available for those who are in need of it.")
